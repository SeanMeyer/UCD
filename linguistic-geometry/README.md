# Linguistic Geometry Project

This project was a semester long effort which culminates in the ability to create what are known as "zones" in [Linguistic Geometry](http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/Engineering/research/Computer-Science-and-Engineering/Pages/ArtificialIntelligencyLinguisticGeometry.aspx), in the specific case of a chess board.

## Usage

Run one of the exe's (reachability.exe, trajectories.exe, zones.exe) and follow the prompts in the console. Information will be displayed in both the console and a browser window that opens automatically.

## Trajectories Sample Output

Here is an example of the output from the trajectory code, given a few different input scenarios.

## Zones Sample Output

Here is an example of the output from the zones code, given a specific starting scenario.
